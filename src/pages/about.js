                I have recently finished studying a MSc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at UCC. This course provides a solid foundation in data analysis using R and Python primarily, while also using mathematical models to study the complex field of genomes and DNA. I have a BSc in Computer Science and Information Technology from NUI Galway. While studying in Galway I gained in-depth coverage of core computer science and software engineering technologies. I chose to study a range of next-generation technology areas, including digital media and games, data analytics, energy informatics, cloud computing and medical/bioinformatics.

                I have worked full-time as a software engineer at WAZP, a 3D Printing Supply Chain company located in Tralee, Co. Kerry. In this role I had the opportunity to work with different professionals in a small fast paced company. I also like to work on personal projects. I have experience in Python and have educational experience working with Java and C. I also have knowledge working with Bootstrap, React, HTML and CSS. Take a look at my work on my Github.
